# README

This repositor providse guides and tutorials for a hands-on learning approach of Agilekip's Process Aware Information Systems Scaffolding (PAIS).

PAIS enables the simple transformation of Business Processes into interactive and executable webapps using JHipster. With it, you can seamlessly transform BPMN files into software systems automatically, with only a minimal amount of set-up and maintenance.

These tutorials are self-contained, but are best followed sequentially. Interested? Go to the Install Guide for setting up PAIS into your system or, if you already have it installed, start by learning how to create Your First Process.
